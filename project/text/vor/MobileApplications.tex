School Timetable (рис.~\ref{fig:AppSchoolTimetable-AppMyClassSchedule-AppClassPlanner}) is the most easy to use, yet versatile scheduling, planning and organizing app for students of school, college or university. Easily keep track of your weekly school schedule and events, meet deadlines for homework assignments, exams and quizzes in this beautiful tracker accompanied by a homescreen widget. Check out the following features which makes School Timetable the most complete schedule organizer app for students:

- Add room and location, professor name and other information for each class with notes

\paragraph{College Schedule Builder}

Ever sit around struggling to find classes that fit together before registration day? Ever wish you could prioritize professors you like or specify what times you want to have classes? We have and decided it was time for a change.

With College Schedule Builder (рис.~\ref{fig:AppClassTimetable-AppClassSchedule-AppCollegeScheduleBuilder}), or CSB for short, you're able to choose a college we support and let it find schedules that work for you. You tell us what courses you need to take during our semester, the times you would want or not want class, and what professors you would rather get or avoid. With that information, we will search through all the combinations of the course sections to find the ones that meet your requirements. Once you find one that you like, you can save it in the app for reference until registration day comes.
